        Long Beach, a coastal city in Southern California, holds a distinctive charm as
        a diverse and lively urban destination. Home to a population with a rich
        tapestry of backgrounds, Long Beach has evolved into a unique cultural hub.
        Its development began as a seaside resort in the late 19th century, and it has
        grown to become a significant port city and thriving community. California was
        admitted to the Union on September 9, 1850, becoming the 31st state of the
        United States. Long Beach is situated within the larger Southern California
        region, offering a pleasant Mediterranean climate and a picturesque waterfront
        location. The city's average income level mirrors its varied demographics, with
        median household incomes approximating $60,000. Classified as an urban area,
        Long Beach showcases a blend of historic neighborhoods and contemporary urban
        development, presenting a dynamic and engaging environment for its residents and
        visitors alike.
